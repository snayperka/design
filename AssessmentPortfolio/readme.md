This **portfolio website** has been designed with **a mobile-first approach**, meaning that it is optimized for mobile devices and then adapted to larger screen sizes using media queries. This ensures that the website looks great and **functions well on all screen sizes**.

To create a smooth and visually appealing **user experience**, **transitions** and fade-in **animations** have been implemented throughout the website. The header navigation links have a transition effect that changes the color and opacity of the link when hovered over, making it clear which link the user is hovering over. The fade-in animation is used to gradually reveal content as the user scrolls down the page, creating a professional and engaging experience.

To ensure that the website is optimized for all screen sizes, **media queries** have been used to adjust the layout and styles of the website for different screen sizes. Media queries for screen sizes of 450px, 600px, 700px, 900px, and 1200px have been included in the code. 

The website includes **four external pages**, with the main page being index.html. The skillsSearch.html page includes a search bar that allows employers to quickly find if the site owner has the specific skill they are looking for. The Contact.html page contains a prompt for the user's email, as well as details on how to contact the site owner and links to their social media pages. Finally, the Skills.html page showcases the site owner's skills.

My original idea was to retrieve the API from LinkedIn so that users could view my recently completed LinkedIn courses and newly acquired skills. Unfortunately, LinkedIn does not allow this.
I considered add icon next to each skill, to make them more visually appealing.

Overall, this portfolio website has been designed with a focus on user experience and adaptability to different screen sizes. It provides employers with all the necessary information they need to understand the site owner's skills and experience, making it an effective tool for job searching.
